The most common topic everyone talk about at the beginning of the year is new year resolution. So am I. After many years of trial and error, I find several effective ways to set new year resolution. 

# Group Resolution

Beginning of the year, I noticed that every woman and many men have a new year resolution of losing weight. Either at work or in personal life, I have heard women talking about weight losing strategies and exercise routines. The several gyms I visited so far are all packed with people coming back from their holiday break. Nevertheless, lots of people struggled on this and some don't succeed. 

A strategy developed by one of my coworkers seems to be effective. She posted an announcement on social media saying her husband and her are having a competition. They are both going to lose certain amount of weight in 2 months. If failed, they will publish their current weight on social media and receive a punishment like finishing a Coursera course or making a cell phone app within a week. I hesitated for a while and finally decided to join them. If I don't lose enough weight in 3 months, I am going to publish my weight on social media and read 30 academic papers in a month. I realized that it has become quite an incentive for me to live on red bean soup for several months, and replacing chocolate and snacks with dates, milk tea with green tea. 

# Massive Resolutions

When I have a new year resolution, sometimes I find it difficult to execute. For example, one year my resolution was to go out and meet more people. But when I arrived in the front door of a dinner gathering organized by a local young professional association, I felt really nervous and timid. The feeling did go away after several times, but I didn't really enjoy and wasn't able to build many deep connections from those events. I realized that the more I focus on the one and only new year resolution, the more I would think about how challenging it is and get into the task achieving mindset instead of enjoying my interaction with others. 

This year, I changed to another strategy, which is setting many resolutions. I am currently using the app Trello (a Jira like project management app) to keep track of my new year resolutions. I have X boards of resolutions focusing on X different areas of my life. Each board has N lists. One list contains N-1 goals I want to achieve in that area. The rest of the N-1 lists contains several tasks or cards I need to do to achieve each of the N-1 goals. I created checklist in each card, set due date, and leave comment for any update. By finishing the hierarchical structure of areas - goals - tasks, you not only designed an actionable path to achieve each goal, but also know that as long as you keep working on the small tasks, it will eventually get you to improve certain area of your life. The best part is that you know what matters is not the success or failure of a single task, it is how many tasks you can finish on each list. By having several boards of lists of tasks, your focus will no longer be whether you can achieve one task / goal or not. Instead, your focus will be how much actions or progress you have made towards each list. Without noticing, you realize that you are acting on your new year resolutions almost every minute of your life.  

# Corporate Planning Strategies

In most companies, teams set quarterly, semiannually and annually goals. During the planning seasons, team leaders look back in the past, find out what they did well and what needs to be improved on, figure out the priorities for the next 6-12 months. Then every few months they sit down and check how much progress they have made, and what needs to be worked on more in the rest of the time. This planning process is critical for clarify the priorities, setting the vision and ensure the success of the teams. 

Borrowing the same strategy, one very effective strategy for new year resolution is to set aside certain amount of time each quarter, think about 1. the past, celebrate the good and adjust the not-so-good, 2. your quarterly, semiannually and annually goals, 3. your top priorities. 

I hope this article is helpful for people who are struggling in achieving their new year resolutions or people who don't even believe in setting new year resolutions. I always find this goal setting process to be very exciting because it is a process of me designing my own future and how to get there. When it is done effectively, one can make big progress in their life and become a better person every year.
