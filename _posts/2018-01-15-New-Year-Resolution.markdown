The most common topic everyone talks about at the beginning of a year is new year resolution. So am I. After many years of trial and error, I find several effective ways to set new year resolutions. 

# Group Resolutions

In the beginning of the year, I noticed that almost every woman and many men I know have a new year resolution of losing weight. Either at work or in personal life, I have heard women talking about weight loss strategies and exercise routines. The several gyms I visited so far are all packed with people coming back from their holiday break. Nevertheless, lots of people struggled on achieving their resolutions and some failed. 

A strategy developed by one of my coworkers seems to be effective. She posted an announcement on social media saying she and her husband are having a competition. They are both going to lose certain amount of weight in 2 months. If fail, they will announce their weight on social media and receive a punishment such as finishing a Coursera course or making a cell phone app within a week. I hesitated for a while and finally decided to join them. If I don't lose enough weight in 3 months, I am going to announce my weight on social media and read 30 academic papers in a month. I realize that it has become quite an incentive for me to live on red bean soup for several weeks so far, and replace chocolate and snacks with dates, milk tea with green tea. 

# Massive Resolutions

When I have a new year resolution, sometimes I find it difficult to execute. For example, one year my resolution was to go out and meet more people. But when I arrived in the front door of a dinner gathering organized by a local young professional association, I felt really nervous and timid. The feeling did go away after several times, but I didn't really enjoy and wasn't able to build many deep connections from those events. The more I focus on the one and only new year resolution, the more I would think about how challenging it is and get into the task achieving mindset instead of enjoying my interactions with others. 

This year, I changed my strategy to set massive new year resolutions. I used an app called *Trello* (a Jira like project management app) to keep track of my new year resolutions. I have X boards of resolutions focusing on X different areas of my life. Each board has N lists. One list contains N-1 goals I want to achieve in that area. The rest of the N-1 lists contains several tasks I need to do to achieve each of the N-1 goals. I created checklists in each card, set due dates, and left comments for any progress updates. By finishing the hierarchical structure of areas - goals - tasks, I not only designed an actionable path to  each goal, but also made sure that as long as I keep working on the small tasks, it will eventually get me to improve certain area of my life. The best part is that I know what matters is not the success or failure of a single task, it is how many tasks I can finish on each list. By having several boards of lists of tasks, my focus will no longer be whether I can achieve one task / goal or not. Instead, it will be how much actions or progress I have made towards each list. Without too much efforts, I realize that I am acting on my new year resolutions almost every minute of my daily life.  

# Corporate Planning Strategy

In most companies, teams set quarterly, semiannually and annually goals. During the planning seasons, team leaders look back in the past, find out what they did well and what needs to be improved on, figure out the priorities for the next 6-12 months. Then every few months they sit down and check how much progress they have made, and what needs to be worked on more in the rest of the time. This planning process is critical for clarifying priorities, setting visions and ensuring success.

Inspired by this strategy, one very effective way to deal with new year resolutions is to set aside certain amount of time each quarter, think about 1. the past, celebrate the good and adjust the not-so-good, 2. quarterly, semiannually and annually goals, 3. top priorities. 


I hope this article is helpful for people who are struggling in achieving their new year resolutions or people who don't even believe in setting new year resolutions. I always find the resolution setting process to be very exciting because it is a process of me designing my own future and how to get there. When it is done effectively, one can make big progress in their life and become a different person every year.
